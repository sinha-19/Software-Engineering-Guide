# 12. DevOps & Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)

---

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that improves an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. DevOps unifies software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), emphasizing automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

---

## DevOps Lifecycle

- **Continuous Development:** Code, build, and version control.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Merge code changes frequently, automatically build and test.
- **Continuous Testing:** Automated tests validate builds.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Automatically prepare code for release.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Fully automated deployment to production.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Track application health and performance.

---

## Key Principles

- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks (building, testing, deployment).
- **Collaboration:** Break down silos between development, operations, and QA.
- **Feedback Loops:** Rapid feedback enables quick improvements.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage infrastructure through code (Terraform, CloudFormation).

---

## CI/CD Explained

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - Developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently.
  - Each integration is verified by automated build and tests.
  - Tools: Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitHub Actions.

- **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
  - Ensures code is always in a deployable state.
  - Automated releases to staging/pre-production environments.

- **Continuous Deployment:**
  - Fully automates release to production after passing all tests.

---

## DevOps Tools

- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **Build Automation:** Maven, Gradle
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Travis CI
- **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible, Chef, Puppet
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog

---

## Pipeline Example

1. **Developer pushes code** → 
2. **CI server builds code** → 
3. **Automated tests run** → 
4. **Build artifact created** → 
5. **Deployment script runs** → 
6. **Monitoring and alerts activated**

## Benefits of DevOps

- Faster time to market.
- Improved deployment frequency.
- Lower failure rate of new releases.
- Shorter lead time between fixes.
- Better collaboration and problem-solving.

---

## Challenges

- Cultural resistance to change.
- Tooling complexity.
- Need for upskilling and cross-functional teams.

---

## Best Practices

- Automate everything possible.
- Use version control for configuration and scripts.
- Keep pipelines fast and reliable.
- Roll back changes automatically on failure.
- Monitor applications and infrastructure.
- Use blue/green or canary deployments for safe releases.

---

## Security in DevOps (DevSecOps)

- Integrate security early in the pipeline.
- Automated security testing (SAST, DAST).
- Secrets management and secure configurations.

---

## Interview Questions

1. What is the difference between CI and CD?
2. How would you design a deployment pipeline for a web app?
3. What are the benefits of Infrastructure as Code?
4. How do you ensure security in your CI/CD pipeline?
5. Explain blue/green and canary deployments.

## Exercises

1. Set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.
2. Automate deployment to a test server with Jenkins or CircleCI.
3. Write a Dockerfile to containerize a sample app.
4. Implement a blue/green deployment strategy in a cloud environment.
5. Monitor a deployed application with Prometheus or Grafana.
