## What is Agile?

Agile is a set of values and principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams.

---

## Agile Manifesto Values

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

## Scrum Framework

A popular Agile methodology.

- **Roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- **Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.
- **Events:** Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.

---

## Scrum Process

1. Product Backlog refinement.
2. Sprint Planning (define Sprint Goal).
3. Sprint (1-4 weeks): Build increment.
4. Daily Standup: Synchronize and remove blockers.
5. Sprint Review: Demonstrate completed work.
6. Sprint Retrospective: Reflect and improve.
