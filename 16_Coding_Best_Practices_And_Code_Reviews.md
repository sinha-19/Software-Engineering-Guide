# 16. Coding Best Practices & Code Reviews

---

## Why Follow Coding Best Practices?

Coding best practices help you write code that is readable, maintainable, efficient, and less prone to bugs. They are essential for professional work and collaborative environments.

---

## General Best Practices

- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Keep functions and methods small and focused.
- Avoid code duplication (DRY principle).
- Write modular and reusable code.
- Handle errors and exceptions gracefully.
- Follow a consistent coding style (PEP8, Google style guide, etc.).
- Document code and functions.
- Write unit and integration tests.
- Use version control for all code.

---

## Clean Code Principles

- **Simplicity:** Prefer simple solutions to complex ones.
- **Readability:** Code should be easy to understand.
- **Self-Documenting:** Use code structure and names to convey intent.
- **Refactoring:** Regularly restructure code to improve its quality.

---

## Code Smells

Indicators of deeper problems in code:

- Long methods/classes.
- Duplicate code.
- Large parameter lists.
- Feature envy (one class using anotherâ€™s data excessively).
- Dead code (unused variables, functions).

---

## Refactoring

Improving the structure of existing code without changing its behavior.

- Extract method.
- Rename variable.
- Introduce parameter object.
- Replace magic numbers with named constants.

---

## Code Reviews

- Process of examining code by peers before merging.
- Catches bugs, ensures adherence to standards, and facilitates knowledge sharing.

---

## Code Review Checklist

- Is the code clear and consistent?
- Are there tests for new/changed code?
- Are all requirements met?
- Any security or performance issues?
- Is documentation updated?
- Are edge cases handled?

---

## Automated Code Quality Tools

- **Linters:** Flake8, ESLint, RuboCop
- **Formatters:** Black, Prettier
- **Static Analysis:** SonarQube, CodeClimate

---

## Documentation

- Docstrings and comments for functions, classes.
- README files for repositories.
- API docs using tools like Swagger, Sphinx, JSDoc.

---

## Testing

- Write tests for every new feature and bug fix.
- Use test frameworks (pytest, JUnit, Mocha).
- Maintain high code coverage, but prioritize important paths.

---

## Version Control Best Practices

- Commit small, logical changes with clear messages.
- Use branches for features and bug fixes.
- Review and test code before merging.

---

## Interview Questions

1. What is a code smell? Give examples.
2. How do you conduct a code review?
3. Describe a time you refactored code for maintainability.
4. What are the benefits of automated linting?
5. How do you ensure code quality in a large team?

## Exercises

1. Refactor a function with duplicated logic.
2. Write a code review for a pull request.
3. Configure a linter and fix reported issues.
4. Add docstrings and comments to a codebase.
5. Set up automated tests and review code coverage.

## Summary

Coding best practices and code reviews are key to producing high-quality software. They enhance collaboration, reduce bugs, and make code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
