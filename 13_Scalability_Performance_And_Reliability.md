# 13. Scalability, Performance & Reliability

---

## What is Scalability?

Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. It ensures software can grow with user demand.

---

## Types of Scalability

- **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up):** Add more resources (CPU/RAM) to a single server.
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out):** Add more servers/nodes to distribute load.

---

## Performance Optimization

- **Profiling:** ID bottlenecks using tools (perf, valgrind, profilers).
- **Caching:** Store results in memory (Redis, Memcached) to reduce computation.
- **Database Optimization:** Indexing, query tuning, sharding, replication.
- **Load Balancing:** Evenly distribute requests (Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB).
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Serve static assets close to users.

---

## High Availability (HA)

- Ensures software is accessible and operational most of the time.
- Achieved via redundancy, clustering, failover, and monitoring.

---

## Reliability

- **Redundancy:** Duplicate critical components to avoid single points of failure.
- **Failover:** Automatic switching to backup systems.
- **Replication:** Multiple copies of data for durability.
- **Graceful Degradation:** System continues to function partially during failures.

---

## Monitoring and Alerting

- **Metrics:** Latency, throughput, error rates, resource utilization.
- **Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, Datadog.
- **Logging:** Centralized logs for debugging and audits.
- **Alerting:** Set thresholds for automated notifications.

---

## Disaster Recovery

- **Backups:** Regular and automated, stored offsite.
- **Restore Procedures:** Practice restoring from backup.
- **Data Consistency:** Ensure no data loss or corruption.

---

## Scalability and Reliability Strategies

- **Stateless Services:** Scale easily, as state is externalized.
- **Auto-scaling:** Automatically add/remove resources based on load.
- **Queueing:** Use message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for decoupling.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Prevent cascading failures.

---

## CAP Theorem

- **Consistency:** All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- **Availability:** Every request gets a response.
- **Partition Tolerance:** System continues despite network splits.
- *You can only guarantee two out of three at once.*

---

## Performance Metrics

- **Latency:** Time taken to respond to a request.
- **Throughput:** Number of requests processed per unit of time.
- **Uptime:** Percentage of time system is operational.
- **Error Rate:** Frequency of failed requests.

2. Whatâ€™s the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling?
3. Describe a caching strategy you have implemented.
4. How do you ensure high availability in cloud deployments?
5. What is the CAP theorem?
