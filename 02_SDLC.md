# 02. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

---

## What is SDLC?

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a comprehensive process that outlines the steps required to build high-quality software efficiently and systematically. It defines the stages from concept to retirement, ensuring disciplined software production, risk management, and optimal resource use.

---

## Why Use SDLC?

- **Standardization**: Brings structure and predictability to software projects.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures thorough testing and validation.
- **Cost Control**: Reduces waste and rework.
- **Risk Reduction**: Identifies issues early in the process.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Clarifies deliverables and timelines.

---

## Key Phases of SDLC

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**
   - Identify stakeholders and collect requirements.
   - Analyze feasibility, constraints, and user needs.
   - Document requirements as SRS (Software Requirements Specification).

2. **System and Software Design**
   - Architectural design (high-level).
   - Detailed design (data structures, interfaces, modules).
   - Technology selection and planning for scalability, security, and performance.

3. **Implementation (Coding)**
   - Developers write code as per design documents.
   - Follow coding standards and best practices.
   - Peer reviews and code inspections.

4. **Testing**
   - Unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
   - Bug reporting and tracking.
   - Regression, performance, and security testing.

5. **Deployment**
   - Release planning and staging.
   - Production deployment.
   - User training and documentation.

6. **Maintenance**
   - Bug fixes, enhancements, and updates.
   - System monitoring and support.
   - Adaptation to new requirements or platforms.

## Common SDLC Models

### 1. Waterfall Model
- Linear, sequential approach.
- Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
- Easy to manage but inflexible to changes.

### 2. V-Model (Verification and Validation)
- Extension of the waterfall model.
- Testing activities run in parallel with development phases.

### 3. Incremental and Iterative Model
- Software is built and delivered in increments.
- Each increment adds functionality.
- Feedback-driven, flexible to changes.

### 4. Spiral Model
- Risk-driven, combines iterative and waterfall.
- Focus on risk assessment at each iteration.

### 5. Agile Model
- Iterative, incremental, and highly adaptive.
- Emphasizes customer collaboration, responding to change, and frequent delivery.

### 6. DevOps Model
- Integrates development and operations.
- Focuses on automation, CI/CD, and rapid, reliable releases.

## SDLC in Agile

- Short sprints (1-4 weeks).
- Continuous feedback and iteration.
- Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.

---

## SDLC and Project Management

- **Planning:** Define scope, time, and budget.
- **Tracking:** Use tools (Jira, Trello) to follow progress.
- **Reporting:** Regular updates and stakeholder communication.

---

## Deliverables at Each SDLC Phase

- Requirements: SRS, user stories, use cases.
- Design: Architecture diagrams, data models, interface specs.
- Implementation: Source code, code reviews.
- Testing: Test cases, test reports, bug logs.
- Deployment: Release notes, deployment scripts.
- Maintenance: Change logs, user support documentation.

---

## SDLC Best Practices

- Involve stakeholders continuously.
- Update documentation regularly.
- Use automated build and test pipelines.
- Enforce code standards and peer reviews.
- Maintain version control for all artifacts.

---

## SDLC Pitfalls

- Incomplete requirements or missed stakeholders.
- Poor communication between teams.
- Inadequate testing or rushed deployment.
- Resistance to change or lack of flexibility.
- Neglecting documentation or post-release maintenance.

## Real-World Example

Building an online banking system:
1. Gather requirements from bank staff and customers.
2. Design architecture for security and scalability.
3. Implement features like account management and fund transfers.
4. Test for security, performance, and usability.
5. Deploy in phases (internal, beta, full launch).
6. Maintain through updates and support.

## Exercises

1. Draw an SDLC diagram for a real-world project you know.
2. List artifacts produced in each SDLC phase for an e-commerce site.
3. Compare two SDLC models and discuss when to use each.
4. Explain how DevOps extends the traditional SDLC.

## Summary

The SDLC provides a framework for software teams to deliver effective, reliable, and maintainable software. Understanding its stages, models, and best practices is key for all software engineers and project managers.
